<h1>Intelligent sensing and decision-making lab</h1>
</div>
<p>Intelligent sensing and decision-making lab is directed by Prof. Wen-An Zhang and Prof. Andong Liu at the College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology. We focus on intelligent sensing, control and learning of autonomous systems. My current research interests include information fusion, the application of model predictive control in robots, and robot imitation learning.</p>
