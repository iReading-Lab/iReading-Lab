<h1>Intelligent sensing and decision-making lab</h1>
</div>
<p>Intelligent sensing and decision-making lab is directed by Prof. Wen-An Zhang and Prof. Andong Liu at the Department of Control science and Engineering, College of Information Engineering, 
Zhejiang University of Technology. We focus on intelligent sensing, control and learning for autonomous systems. Current research interests contain information fusing, predictive control, 
robotic control and learning algorithms.</p>
